        <h1>Case Study:</h1>
        <p>Sweetx was a major 2 person eCommerce project for my Java EE class. It was built and developed slowly but surely through different assessments by adding a new feature
            everytime. The main focus of this project was to implement design patterns of software development onto a real project. These design patterns that were applied
            include Factory Method, Abstract Factory Method, the Prototype Design Pattern, the Facade Design, the Builder Design Pattern, and the Iterator Design pattern.
            The work distribution between me and my partner for the project were distributed equally, with each of us developing major features of the program.
            My main contribution although, is the redesign of the landing page UI/UX as it was also important to not only make sure that the program works, but also that the program
            has a very good user interface.
